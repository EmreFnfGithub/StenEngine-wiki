# Friday Night Funkin and Sten Engine
**Friday Night Funkin'** is an open source rhythm game. Developed by a team of four **Newgrounds** users. It has a similar interface to Dance Dance Revolution and PaRappa the Rapper, and has an aesthetic look reminiscent of the browser games popular from the early to mid-2000s.
